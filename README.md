# Exercice-Javascript
 In here i will describe the different part of my training in javascript.
 As a new coder it's been really entertaining doing this stuff.

## Introduction

 The introduction was to make us see the different tools in JavaScript.

## DOM

 We had to change the html file with a .js files using the "pointer".
 I have learn about the "querySelector" and use it to be able to do this exercice.

## Keyboard and Mouse EVENT

 Those one were funny, because it was interactif.

## Training

 The training was a long exercice. It was divide in 7 part. The seventh one took me way more time than the other one.
 We had to look for different prototype to acheive this. Some times it took me hours to just understand how was working a prototype.
 But now i have learn a lot, looking and reading around.

 ## Jeu du Pendu / The HangMan game

  This one was in pair programming. For my pair it was a piece of cake. He did the start and then let me do the rest.
  It was my first project outside the exercices. I threw myself in, got different problem, resolved them. 
  Now i know that i have to go deeper when i'm writing on paper my project :)

  There is still some stuff to do. I need to review and optimize my code.

## The pair game

 Two weeks after the HangMan game, i have start this exercice. It was an easy task.
 But because i have heard from a lot of people that it was not easy I am thinking that i have to do it again from an other logic. When i mean other i mean better of course.
 I don't feel satisfy beacause i have the feeling i have been missing something.
